**Project Title:**
Using Machine Learning to Trace Gastrointestinal Outbreaks and Combat Antimicrobial Resistance

**Overview:**
This project focuses on improving pathogen tracing and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) risk mapping for gastrointestinal (GI) pathogen *Salmonella enterica* serovar Enteritidis. Using machine learning (ML) techniques, the research aims to enhance current genomic surveillance models to make them more accessible and interpretable. By integrating whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, we will develop tools to pinpoint outbreak origins and assess AMR risks across diverse regions, addressing key global public health challenges.

**Group Members:**
- Mike Nusubuga, PhD student

**Outcomes & Impacts:**
Expected outcomes include advanced ML models that can trace the origins of GI pathogens and predict AMR risk associated with these regions with high accuracy. Mike hopes to  development of an intuitive, web-based platform will make these tools accessible to both experts and non-specialists, enhancing the global capacity for genomic surveillance.
