**Project Title:** Using Nanopore Sequencing for Rapid Antimicrobial Resistance Profiling of Non-typhoidal *Salmonella* in South Africa

**Overview:** This project addresses antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Non-typhoidal *Salmonella enterica* (NTS) in South Africa, which poses a significant health threat, especially to vulnerable populations with conditions such as HIV and malnutrition. Using nanopore sequencing, the research will rapidly detect AMR profiles and improve diagnostic capabilities. Local researchers will be trained in whole genome sequencing (WGS) and bioinformatics, which will enhance South Africa's ability to combat AMR and strengthen public health systems.

**Group Members**

- Dr Sion Bayliss, Group Leader
- Helen Hoshall, PDRA

**Collaborators:**
- Dr Ruan Marais, Division of Medical Microbiology, University of Cape Town
- Prof Adrian Brink, Division of Medical Microbiology, University of Cape Town

**Outcomes & Impacts:** This project will deliver a rapid sequencing tool to profile AMR in NTS, enabling quicker and more accurate treatment of infections. It will also enhance local diagnostic capacity in South Africa through capacity-building and training. 

**Funding:** This research is funded by the Elizabeth Blackwell Institute under the Quality-Related (QR) Research England International Science Partnerships Fund (ISPF) award to the University of Bristol.
