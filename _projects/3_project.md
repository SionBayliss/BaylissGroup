**Project Title:**
Harnessing CRISPR-Cas to Reduce Ammonia Emissions in Poultry Production

**Overview:**
This project aims to tackle the critical issue of ammonia emissions from poultry production, which are a significant environmental concern in the UK. By utilising probiotic bacteria equipped with the CRISPR-Cas system, the research will target and deactivate the microbial enzymes responsible for ammonia production. This innovative approach seeks to provide a sustainable solution for reducing ammonia emissions at the source, improving animal welfare, productivity, and environmental health in intensive farming regions like the Wye Valley.

**Group Members:**
- Helen Howshall, PDRA
- Dr Sion Bayliss, Group Leader

**Collaborations:**

**Outcomes & Impacts:**
The project expects to produce effective probiotic solutions that can significantly lower ammonia emissions in poultry housing. The successful application of this technology will not only enhance animal welfare and farm productivity but may also be adapted for use in other agricultural practices in the future. This work aims to mitigate the environmental impact of nitrogen runoff and promote better management of agricultural waste, thereby benefiting biodiversity and local ecosystems.

**Funding:**This project is funded by INNOVATE UK in partnership with DEFRA.
