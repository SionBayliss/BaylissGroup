Mike is a PhD student funded by the GW4 BioMed2 MRC DTP in Population Health. His project centers on developing cutting-edge machine learning tools aimed at predicting the source outbreaks of foodborne diseases, alongside identifying the genomic mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These tools will be used to support public health decision-making and facilitate rapid response to future outbreaks.

Mike previously completed his MSc in Bioinformatics supported by the Fogarty International Center (FIC) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the EANBIT project at Makerere University where my research focussed on evaluating the practicality and broader adaptability of machine learning models, particularly in the realm of identifying antimicrobial resistance within low-middle-income countries (LMICs).
