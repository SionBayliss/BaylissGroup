Cara is an evolutionary biologist specialising in how natural selection maintains genetic diversity in natural populations. With expertise in quantitative genetics, bioinformatics, population genomics, and biostatistics, Cara earned her PhD from The University of Queensland, Australia. After completing her PhD, she worked with Sion Bayliss, using bacterial sequencing datasets to examine the uneven distribution of loss-of-function mutations across the Staphylococcus aureus genome. This research focused on how varying selection pressures shape genomic architecture and differentiate between essential and accessory genes in bacterial populations.

Cara has recently joined Michiel Vos at the University of Exeter on a joint porject with thge Bayliss Lab to investigate the age and fitness distribution of accessory genes within bacterial pangenomes, providing insights into their role in adaptation and genomic diversity. Passionate about teaching and collaboration, she also enjoys mentoring students in programming and partnering with researchers in ecology and conservation to uncover new insights into adaptation.
