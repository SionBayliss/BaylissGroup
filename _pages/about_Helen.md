Helen has a background in zoology and studied her masterâ€™s and PhD at Bristol Veterinary School (BVS). Her PhD had a strong microbiology focus, researching the potential bacterial involvement in the elusive canine disease, Cutaneous Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy (CRGV). More recently, she has been setting up and developing methods for long-read Nanopore sequencing to support the growing Genomics specisalism in BVS.

Helen works across two Innovate UK funded projects with PIs Sion Bayliss and Tristan Cogan in which she develops DNA sequencing strategies for the modulation of microbial communities associated with farmed animals.

Outside of work, Helen is happiest with her two collie crosses, who keep her busy.
