Caroline is a PhD student funded by the GW4 BioMed2 MRC DTP. She completed her undergraduate studies in Biochemistry and Genetics at the University of Cape Town and went on to study a MSc in Data Science and Analytics at Cardiff University. Caroline's PhD project, entitled 'Genomic Surveillance Meets Machine Learning: Predicting the Origins of Salmonella Outbreaks with Machine Learning', aims to develop models from genomic data to predict the geographical source of gastrointestinal pathogens. Her intent is to focus on deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence methods for source attribution, with the aim of improving public health responses.
