Amina Ismail Ahmed is the Joint Head of the Salmonella Reference Service at the Gastrointestinal Bacteria Reference Unit (GBRU), UKHSA, Colindale. She is currently undertaking a part-time PhD in the Bayliss Lab entitled "A Genomic and Phenotypic Exploration of Chronic Salmonella Infections in the UK," which aims to explore the genetic differences between *Salmonella* strains causing acute infections and those leading to chronic, long-term infections. Her research will focus on understanding why certain strains persist and how factors such as antibiotic resistance and virulence contribute to these chronic infections. The analysis for her PhD will be conducted on genomic data generated by GBRU from Salmonella samples referred by clinical laboratories across England and Wales for surveillance purposes.

In her role at the GBRU, Amina is responsible for overseeing the operations of the Salmonella Reference Service, which includes developing and implementing advanced testing methods, such as PCR and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). Additionally, Amina contributes to outbreak investigations by providing genomic and microbiological information and supports the training and development of other microbiologists within the unit.
