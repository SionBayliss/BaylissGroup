**The Bayliss Group** focuses on leveraging genomics datasets to develop novel machine learning, bioinformatics, and diagnostic methodologies aimed at combating the emergence of problematic pathogens in the public health and sustainable food production sectors. Our work emphasises interdisciplinarity and co-production of knowledge with stakeholders.

We study a range of *One Health* pathogens, including nosocomial pathogens (*Staphylococcus aureus*, *Enterococcus faecium*) and foodborne pathogens (*Campylobacter* and *Enterobacteriaceae*), with a specialisation in endemic disease of poultry and emerging diseases in the aquaculture sector. Our current research programme focuses on pathogens of the food chain, from production to consumption, such as *Salmonella* species. 

Our research programme can be divided into two primary fields:

1. The use of novel computer science methodologies to develop translational tools for combating and managing diseases in public health and sustainable food production sectors. These include the use of machine learning for source attribution and the rapid identification of recombination in large genomic datasets.  

2. The application of long-read sequencing as a rapid diagnostic tool for human and animal disease management. Projects include assessing bacterial community diversity as a biomarker for gut health, as well as *in silico* AMR resistance typing from biological samples such as whole blood.
